  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  My Project is a backend program for an online store that communicates with a MySQL database using Sequelize. A user may browse the items, categories, and tags using insomnia, as well as modify the database using CRUD operations.

  I created this project to help stores that sell stuff online for example clothing.

  Anyone can use this project for their online store.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  To install this project first clone this repo to your computer and install mysql2 and sequelize.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  To utilize this application, a user must first launch the server on a local computer. They must then make database requests using a program like Insomina. To do that use terminal to get into your file path and first use the following command 'npm run seed' and then use the following command 'npm start' and it will start on your local server.
